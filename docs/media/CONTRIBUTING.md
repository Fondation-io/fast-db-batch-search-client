## Commit Messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages. This leads to more readable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history. It also enables automatic version management via semantic-release.

### Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**. The header has a special format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

#### Type

Must be one of the following:

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

#### Scope

The scope should be the name of the module affected (as perceived by the person reading the changelog generated from commit messages).

#### Subject

The subject contains a succinct description of the change:

- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- don't capitalize the first letter
- no dot (.) at the end

### Examples

```
feat(client): add progress tracking for batch operations
```

```
fix(types): correct type definition for search results
```

```
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## Code Style

- We use TypeScript for type safety
- We use ESLint for linting
- We use Prettier for code formatting
- Run `npm run format` before committing

## Testing

- Write tests for any new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR
- Aim for high code coverage

## Documentation

- Update the README.md if you change functionality
- Add JSDoc comments to all public APIs
- Update the examples if you add new features

## Release Process

We use semantic-release to automatically release new versions based on commit messages. When a PR is merged to main:

1. semantic-release analyzes the commits
2. Determines the next version number
3. Generates the changelog
4. Creates a GitHub release
5. Publishes to npm
