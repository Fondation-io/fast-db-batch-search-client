### Bug Fixes

- correct all examples to match actual BatchSearchClient API ([9289fb7](https://github.com/fondation-io/fast-db-batch-search-client/commit/9289fb7cfc38c99906cc3f014ed80572e43e2fcb))

### BREAKING CHANGES

- The examples now correctly show that batchSearch expects a single author and a list of titles, not multiple independent searches.
